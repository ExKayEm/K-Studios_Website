    <h1 align="center" style="font-family:verdana;">History of K-Studios®</h1>
    <br>
    <div id="HistoryHolder">
      <h3 id="HistoryTitle">FIGHTZONE®</h3>
      <p id="HistoryText">Firstly, K-Studios was originally named FIGHTZONE®, and we mainly created and developed games on the Roblox platform. We were somewhat popular from the start and had been a trusted studio. Unfortunately, our studio was discontinued in early 2020.</p>
      <br>
      <br>
      <h3 id="HistoryTitle">GreenZone®</h3>
      <p id="HistoryText">Afterward, our studio was renamed GreenZone® and given a completely new HR team, though we kept the same people in lower positions. We continued developing games on the Roblox platform, but we also created our own Minecraft servers. To be honest, we were more motivated by Minecraft than Roblox. Unfortunately, shortly after, in April, we were abandoned by the most important members of our HR team, which led to another discontinuation.</p>
      <br>
      <br>
      <h3 id="HistoryTitle">Earl Raid Studios®</h3>
      <p id="HistoryText">Earl Raid Studios® operated from June 2020 until late December 2021. During this period, we had the best HR team and developers in our entire history. We continued some of the GreenZone® Roblox projects, maintained our Minecraft server, and also developed simple apps and games for Android devices. Our HR team and other departments were very stable at Earl Raid Studios®. As mentioned, in late December 2021, Earl Raid Studios® ceased to exist, not due to a lack of resources or workers, but because we decided to change the name of our studio and change our history for the better.</p>
      <br>
      <br>
      <h3 id="HistoryTitle">K-Studios®</h3>
      <p id="HistoryText">In late December 2021, we rebranded our studio as K-Studios® and continued creating both Roblox and Minecraft servers, along with simple apps and games for Android devices. By late December 2022, our team had dropped to just four members, and we were forced to discontinue managing any Roblox and Minecraft servers, as well as our official Discord server. Despite these challenges, we shifted our focus to improving our development of apps and games for Android devices and began working on simple *.bat and *.vbs projects for Windows PCs. During this time, we also created and have been developing this website, which reflects our journey.</p>
      <br>
      <p id="HistoryText">Today, this website stands as a testament to how a small studio’s history and struggles shaped its evolution, presenting a series of problems and solutions that ultimately led to us becoming only a memory. And yet, K-Studios lives on, continuing to adapt and grow despite the odds.</p>
